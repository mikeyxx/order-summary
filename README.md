## Overview

For me, this challenge was just supposed to be a warm up to building projects. I started learning to code since May this year and I have built similar projects so I started with a project in the newbie category to help me refresh before moving on to more complex projects. I have also just learnt SASS so I wanted to integrate SASS into this project. However, after downloading the file and before writing my html, I froze a little, and it felt like I had forgotten how to add a <link>, had to open my previous projects to check some basic things lol. It got easier though once I started writing. The few things I found challenging were how to size my img to the size of the rest of the document. I read somewhere that using a static width and height is not good for building a responsive design so I found it really difficult figuring out how to set a base style for my illustration-hero-svg and the rest of the page. To get this done, I have to set the container div and the image to the same width and make the page width 100%. The design came out as I wanted and I'm happy to have completed my first project after a while. I also successfully used SASS.:)

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover states for interactive elements

### Links
- Live Site URL:(https://project-order-summary.netlify.app/)

## My process
- HTML markup
- SASS sheet
- Added a link to my CSS to my HTML page
- Wrote my global variables
- Custom style for the project
- Push to git
- Made the project live

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I learnt how to use some SASS, although it was basic but I'm proud I was able to use it for my project.
I also learnt how to use style the width of my svg file.

### Continued development

I hope to work on my projects to learn more about layout. In fact in my next project, I will be working on something that would require the use of both grid and flexbox. I'm excited.
